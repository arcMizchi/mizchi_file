1.Overview
This is a program to record troubles or bugs about <host> PC.
If trouble occurs, PC administrator must leave a log about that problem and share it with
your members.
Message log is recorded in "log/message" and renew every month. Previous log is recorded
in "log/message<date>" with date. Also, logs of that year is compressed and save it
collectively to "logs" in year-end. So, PC administrator must organized log files in
year-end.

## Notes ##
This program is made on the assumption that files are shared by multiple PCs. So, it cannot be
used when managing problems on a single PC.

2.Usage
Clients use "report" shell in each client's PC bin. Notes that client's shell is different from
administrator's shell.
Clients can send log about trouble by using "<bin/report>" shell.

[user@host]$ report

If you send log about problems, a mail about it will be sent to administrator.
Configure of administrator is set by "setup" or "<bin/admin_mail>". Also, you can aset it by
adding user's email to "<configure/adm_adr>".
